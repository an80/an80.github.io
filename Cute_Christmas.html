                        She's a bit of a crybaby,but still doing her best everyday, never letting things go till the very end.
                        Her wish is for a big brother who can help her fix all the sad things.
                        It seems like her main reason for crying is because of things breaking.
                        Her parents broke up so she has acquired a trauma of sorts.
                        As a reward for you each time you fix a thing for her the second time you will be able to do it instantly without the need for materials.</p>

                    Lately she has been having nightmares.
                    From what I can see her rough father is the source of them.
                    In order to become a proper dragon her father is putting her through spartan training doing awfull things like leaving her alone in the jungle.
                    Her wish was for the softest pillow.
                    I hope you can help however you deem fit whether aliviating the training or just comforting her.
                    For this I'll give you a the gift of soothing the suroundings.
                    This ability will only be as strong as your love.</p>

                    Her dreams all shatered as of young,by her parent's logical demeanor denying anything not in their field of view,even me!
                    Being inexperienced and unable to emulate other people's feelings has led her to a one-colored life consisting only of studying.
                    Her wish was for a wish.
                    I want you to give her a dream stronger than any logic, and for that reason I'll let you control 'illusions',your belief determining their briliance.

                    She has been having a rough time lately.
                    All her friend's have been avoiding her because of her tendency to hug people HARD.
                    I have no idea what they fed this girl but you have to prepare for having your bones broken if you want to get close to her.
                    Don't think about dodging it she believes that to be a way to show that you are friends so denying it will hurt her.
                    To make things easier for you I'll raise you resistance,you will grow resistant to damage as you experience it more and more.

                        Piu is apparently the only one left of her race.
                        Having slept in some kind of cryo chamber for who knows how many years she has finally awoken in some kind of underground facility.
                        Lost and confused her wish is for a guide.
                        I'll give you the power of knowledge,the longer you focus on learning about something the more you'll be able to discover new information about it.
                        While her wish may be such she is unusually smart for her age the only thing stopping her from adapting to the situation is her sadness.
                        If you heal her trauma you may hear her witty comebacks back in their full glory!

                        Because I am a generous I'll still give you a gift.
                        This is a miniuature version of my strength,the power of Christmas,you'll be able to complete all your minor wishes with it, maybe someday you'll even learn enough from my great self to complete all of them.
                        Don't expect to have an easy time with me I'll work you until you regret picking me.
                        a-and maybe if you follow me even through that we can have fun together, go to the beach ,play games,or even go on on a ddddate...

                <p>Now I am gonna send you to their world.
                    It's on the same technology level as yours, but with magic.
                    Now when you meet the girl's parents(if she has any) they'll think of you as their son so keep that in mind.
                    All of the logistics of that are my doing so that you can focus on your task.
                    When you are done I can return you to the same time as I took you(with your age at the time too) but that's if you wish for it.
                    And last remember that this is your wish as much as the girl's don't forget to have fun.
                    Merry Christmas,till next year.
